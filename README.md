# game-of-life-go-htmx
Fun project to learn Go and HTMX

Stores Game of Life game states in SQLite

Roadmap:
 - Authentication
 - Rewind (destructive or non-destructive?)
 - Loop detection 
 - High score = Lowest number of iterations before reaching a stable loop
 - High score - longest loop
 - Set your own initial state? (high score would not apply)
 - replay loop
